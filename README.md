# Bitmap-ST7789
I intend to convert these images into comprehensible code for micro to display them or so-called images as Bitmap.

## What it DO!
You may have thought about displaying an image type on your TFT screen, but in these scenarios the problem is that the source of the image being loaded by our microcontroller and displayed on TFT LCDs must be some kind of memory card. So that the information can be read by an SD card reader to be analyzed in our micro and finally displayed. This will cause additional costs and complicate the steps, as well as the dependence of the circuit on the module and information beyond our reach, so in this tutorial we intend to convert these images into comprehensible code for micro Show them or so-called images as Bitmap.

### Items needed
-TFT LCD St7789
-Wemos

### Required libraries
-TFT_eSPI

## Conclusion
In this project, by converting an image to code, we were able to display the image without the need for external memory. This display has a resolution of 240 Û´ 240, which means a total of 57,600 pixels, so we first resized the image in Photoshop to this size. Convert and then by converting this image to color code, we obtained the pixels of each pixel, which was finally displayed on the LCD screen by introducing the program image code.
